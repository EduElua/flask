Testing Flask Applications
==========================

   **Something that is untested is broken.**

The origin of this quote is unknown and while it is not entirely correct, it
is also not far from the truth.  Untested applications make it hard to
improve existing code and developers of untested applications tend to
become pretty paranoid.  If an application has automated tests, you can
safely make changes and instantly know if anything breaks.

Flask provides a way to test your application by exposing the Werkzeug
test :class:`~werkzeug.test.Client` and handling the context locals for you.
You can then use that with your favourite testing solution.

In this documentation we will use the `pytest`_ and `coverage`_ package as the base
framework for our tests. You can install it with ``pip``, like so::

.. code-block:: none

    $ pip install pytest coverage

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/
.. _coverage: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/

The Application
---------------

First, we need an application to test; we will use the application from
the :doc:`tutorial/index`. If you don't have that application yet, get
the source code from :gh:`the examples <examples/tutorial>`.

So that we can import the module ``flaskr`` correctly, we need to run
``pip install -e .`` in the folder ``tutorial``.

The Testing Setup and Fixtures
------------------------------

The test code is located in the ``tests`` directory, which is located under
the application root. The testing file anf functions are formatted like
``test_*.py`` and ``def test_*():``. They will be auto-discoverable by pytest.

The ``tests/conftest.py`` file contains setup functions called fixtures that
each test will use.

Each test will create a new temporary database file and populate some data that
will be used in the tests. Write a SQL file to insert that data.


.. code-block:: sql
    :caption: ``tests/data.sql``

    INSERT INTO user (username, password)
    VALUES
      ('test', 'pbkdf2:sha256:50000$TCI4GzcX$0de171a4f4dac32e3364c7ddc7c14f3e2fa61f2d17574483f7ffbb431b4acb2f'),
      ('other', 'pbkdf2:sha256:50000$kJPKsz6N$d2d4784f1b030a9761f5ccaeeaca413f27f2ecb76d6168407af962ddce849f79');

    INSERT INTO post (title, body, author_id, created)
    VALUES
      ('test title', 'test' || x'0a' || 'body', 1, '2018-01-01 00:00:00');

The ``app`` fixture will call the factory and pass ``test_config`` to
configure the application and database for testing instead of using your
local development configuration.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/conftest.py``

    import os
    import tempfile

    import pytest
    from flaskr import create_app
    from flaskr.db import get_db, init_db


    with open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'data.sql'), 'rb') as f:
        _data_sql = f.read().decode('utf8')

    @pytest.fixture
    def app():
        db_fd, db_path = tempfile.mkstemp()

        app = create_app({
            'TESTING': True,
            'DATABASE': db_path,
        })

        with app.app_context():
            init_db()
            get_db().executescript(_data_sql)

        yield app

        os.close(db_fd)
        os.unlink(db_path)


    @pytest.fixture
    def client(app):
        return app.test_client()


    @pytest.fixture
    def runner(app):
        return app.test_cli_runner()

:func:`tempfile.mkstemp` creates and opens a temporary file, returning
the file object and the path to it. The ``DATABASE`` path is
overridden so it points to this temporary path instead of the instance
folder. After setting the path, the database tables are created and the
test data is inserted. After the test is over, the temporary file is
closed and removed.

:data:`TESTING` tells Flask that the app is in test mode. Flask changes
some internal behavior so it's easier to test, and other extensions can
also use the flag to make testing them easier.

The ``client`` fixture calls
:meth:`app.test_client() <Flask.test_client>` with the application
object created by the ``app`` fixture. Tests will use the client to make
requests to the application without running the server.

The ``runner`` fixture is similar to ``client``.
:meth:`app.test_cli_runner() <Flask.test_cli_runner>` creates a runner
that can call the Click commands registered with the application.

Pytest uses fixtures by matching their function names with the names
of arguments in the test functions. For example, the ``test_hello``
function you'll write next takes a ``client`` argument. Pytest matches
that with the ``client`` fixture function, calls it, and passes the
returned value to the test function.


.. _pytest fixture:
   https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html


Factory
-------

There's not much to test about the factory itself. Most of the code will
be executed for each test already, so if something fails the other tests
will notice.

The only behavior that can change is passing test config. If config is
not passed, there should be some default configuration, otherwise the
configuration should be overridden.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_factory.py``

    from flaskr import create_app


    def test_config():
        assert not create_app().testing
        assert create_app({'TESTING': True}).testing


    def test_hello(client):
        response = client.get('/hello')
        assert response.data == b'Hello, World!'

You added the ``hello`` route as an example when writing the factory at
the beginning of the tutorial. It returns "Hello, World!", so the test
checks that the response data matches.


Database
--------

Within an application context, ``get_db`` should return the same
connection each time it's called. After the context, the connection
should be closed.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_db.py``

    import sqlite3

    import pytest
    from flaskr.db import get_db


    def test_get_close_db(app):
        with app.app_context():
            db = get_db()
            assert db is get_db()

        with pytest.raises(sqlite3.ProgrammingError) as e:
            db.execute('SELECT 1')

        assert 'closed' in str(e.value)

The ``init-db`` command should call the ``init_db`` function and output
a message.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_db.py``

    def test_init_db_command(runner, monkeypatch):
        class Recorder(object):
            called = False

        def fake_init_db():
            Recorder.called = True

        monkeypatch.setattr('flaskr.db.init_db', fake_init_db)
        result = runner.invoke(args=['init-db'])
        assert 'Initialized' in result.output
        assert Recorder.called

This test uses Pytest's ``monkeypatch`` fixture to replace the
``init_db`` function with one that records that it's been called. The
``runner`` fixture you wrote above is used to call the ``init-db``
command by name.


Authentication
--------------

For most of the views, a user needs to be logged in. The easiest way to
do this in tests is to make a ``POST`` request to the ``login`` view
with the client. Rather than writing that out every time, you can write
a class with methods to do that, and use a fixture to pass it the client
for each test.


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/conftest.py``

    class AuthActions(object):
        def __init__(self, client):
            self._client = client

        def login(self, username='test', password='test'):
            return self._client.post(
                '/auth/login',
                data={'username': username, 'password': password}
            )

        def logout(self):
            return self._client.get('/auth/logout')


    @pytest.fixture
    def auth(client):
        return AuthActions(client)

        username = flaskr.app.config["USERNAME"]
        password = flaskr.app.config["PASSWORD"]

        rv = login(client, username, password)
        assert b'You were logged in' in rv.data


With the ``auth`` fixture, you can call ``auth.login()`` in a test to
log in as the ``test`` user, which was inserted as part of the test
data in the ``app`` fixture.


The ``register`` view should render successfully on ``GET``. On ``POST``
with valid form data, it should redirect to the login URL and the user's
data should be in the database. Invalid data should display error
messages.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_auth.py``

        rv = login(client, f"{username}x", password)
        assert b'Invalid username' in rv.data

        rv = login(client, username, f'{password}x')
        assert b'Invalid password' in rv.data

    import pytest
    from flask import g, session
    from flaskr.db import get_db


    def test_register(client, app):
        assert client.get('/auth/register').status_code == 200
        response = client.post(
            '/auth/register', data={'username': 'a', 'password': 'a'}
        )
        assert 'http://localhost/auth/login' == response.headers['Location']

        with app.app_context():
            assert get_db().execute(
                "select * from user where username = 'a'",
            ).fetchone() is not None


    @pytest.mark.parametrize(('username', 'password', 'message'), (
        ('', '', b'Username is required.'),
        ('a', '', b'Password is required.'),
        ('test', 'test', b'already registered'),
    ))
    def test_register_validate_input(client, username, password, message):
        response = client.post(
            '/auth/register',
            data={'username': username, 'password': password}
        )
        assert message in response.data

:meth:`client.get() <werkzeug.test.Client.get>` makes a ``GET`` request
and returns the :class:`Response` object returned by Flask. Similarly,
:meth:`client.post() <werkzeug.test.Client.post>` makes a ``POST``
request, converting the ``data`` dict into form data.

To test that the page renders successfully, a simple request is made and
checked for a ``200 OK`` :attr:`~Response.status_code`. If
rendering failed, Flask would return a ``500 Internal Server Error``
code.

:attr:`~Response.headers` will have a ``Location`` header with the login
URL when the register view redirects to the login view.

:attr:`~Response.data` contains the body of the response as bytes. If
you expect a certain value to render on the page, check that it's in
``data``. Bytes must be compared to bytes. If you want to compare
Unicode text, use :meth:`get_data(as_text=True) <werkzeug.wrappers.BaseResponse.get_data>`
instead.

``pytest.mark.parametrize`` tells Pytest to run the same test function
with different arguments. You use it here to test different invalid
input and error messages without writing the same code three times.

The tests for the ``login`` view are very similar to those for
``register``. Rather than testing the data in the database,
:data:`session` should have ``user_id`` set after logging in.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_auth.py``

    def test_login(client, auth):
        assert client.get('/auth/login').status_code == 200
        response = auth.login()
        assert response.headers['Location'] == 'http://localhost/'

        with client:
            client.get('/')
            assert session['user_id'] == 1
            assert g.user['username'] == 'test'


    @pytest.mark.parametrize(('username', 'password', 'message'), (
        ('a', 'test', b'Incorrect username.'),
        ('test', 'a', b'Incorrect password.'),
    ))
    def test_login_validate_input(auth, username, password, message):
        response = auth.login(username, password)
        assert message in response.data

Using ``client`` in a ``with`` block allows accessing context variables
such as :data:`session` after the response is returned. Normally,
accessing ``session`` outside of a request would raise an error.

Testing ``logout`` is the opposite of ``login``. :data:`session` should
not contain ``user_id`` after logging out.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_auth.py``

    def test_logout(client, auth):
        auth.login()

        with client:
            auth.logout()
            assert 'user_id' not in session


Blog
--------------------

All the blog views use the ``auth`` fixture you wrote earlier. Call
``auth.login()`` and subsequent requests from the client will be logged
in as the ``test`` user.

The ``index`` view should display information about the post that was
added with the test data. When logged in as the author, there should be
a link to edit the post.

You can also test some more authentication behavior while testing the
``index`` view. When not logged in, each page shows links to log in or
register. When logged in, there's a link to log out.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_blog.py``

    import pytest
    from flaskr.db import get_db


    def test_index(client, auth):
        response = client.get('/')
        assert b"Log In" in response.data
        assert b"Register" in response.data

        auth.login()
        response = client.get('/')
        assert b'Log Out' in response.data
        assert b'test title' in response.data
        assert b'by test on 2018-01-01' in response.data
        assert b'test\nbody' in response.data
        assert b'href="/1/update"' in response.data

A user must be logged in to access the ``create``, ``update``, and
``delete`` views. The logged in user must be the author of the post to
access ``update`` and ``delete``, otherwise a ``403 Forbidden`` status
is returned. If a ``post`` with the given ``id`` doesn't exist,
``update`` and ``delete`` should return ``404 Not Found``.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_blog.py``

    @pytest.mark.parametrize('path', (
        '/create',
        '/1/update',
        '/1/delete',
    ))
    def test_login_required(client, path):
        response = client.post(path)
        assert response.headers['Location'] == 'http://localhost/auth/login'


    def test_author_required(app, client, auth):
        # change the post author to another user
        with app.app_context():
            db = get_db()
            db.execute('UPDATE post SET author_id = 2 WHERE id = 1')
            db.commit()

        auth.login()
        # current user can't modify other user's post
        assert client.post('/1/update').status_code == 403
        assert client.post('/1/delete').status_code == 403
        # current user doesn't see edit link
        assert b'href="/1/update"' not in client.get('/').data


    @pytest.mark.parametrize('path', (
        '/2/update',
        '/2/delete',
    ))
    def test_exists_required(client, auth, path):
        auth.login()
        assert client.post(path).status_code == 404

The ``create`` and ``update`` views should render and return a
``200 OK`` status for a ``GET`` request. When valid data is sent in a
``POST`` request, ``create`` should insert the new post data into the
database, and ``update`` should modify the existing data. Both pages
should show an error message on invalid data.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_blog.py``

    def test_create(client, auth, app):
        auth.login()
        assert client.get('/create').status_code == 200
        client.post('/create', data={'title': 'created', 'body': ''})

        with app.app_context():
            db = get_db()
            count = db.execute('SELECT COUNT(id) FROM post').fetchone()[0]
            assert count == 2


    def test_update(client, auth, app):
        auth.login()
        assert client.get('/1/update').status_code == 200
        client.post('/1/update', data={'title': 'updated', 'body': ''})

        with app.app_context():
            db = get_db()
            post = db.execute('SELECT * FROM post WHERE id = 1').fetchone()
            assert post['title'] == 'updated'


    @pytest.mark.parametrize('path', (
        '/create',
        '/1/update',
    ))
    def test_create_update_validate(client, auth, path):
        auth.login()
        response = client.post(path, data={'title': '', 'body': ''})
        assert b'Title is required.' in response.data

The ``delete`` view should redirect to the index URL and the post should
no longer exist in the database.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: ``tests/test_blog.py``

    def test_delete(client, auth, app):
        auth.login()
        response = client.post('/1/delete')
        assert response.headers['Location'] == 'http://localhost/'

        with app.app_context():
            db = get_db()
            post = db.execute('SELECT * FROM post WHERE id = 1').fetchone()
            assert post is None

Running the Tests
-----------------

Some extra configuration, which is not required but makes running
tests with coverage less verbose, can be added to the project's
``setup.cfg`` file.

.. code-block:: none
    :caption: ``setup.cfg``

    [tool:pytest]
    testpaths = tests

    [coverage:run]
    branch = True
    source =
        flaskr

To run the tests, use the ``pytest`` command. It will find and run all
the test functions you've written.

.. code-block:: none

    $ pytest

If any tests fail, pytest will show the error that was raised. You can
run ``pytest -v`` to get a list of each test function rather than dots.

To measure the code coverage of your tests, use the ``coverage`` command
to run pytest instead of running it directly.

.. code-block:: none

    $ coverage run -m pytest

You can either view a simple coverage report in the terminal:

.. code-block:: none

    $ coverage report

    Name                 Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover

An HTML report allows you to see which lines were covered in each file:

.. code-block:: none

    $ coverage html

This generates files in the ``htmlcov`` directory. Open
``htmlcov/index.html`` in your browser to see the report.



Other Testing Tricks
--------------------

Besides using the test client as shown above, there is also the
:meth:`~flask.Flask.test_request_context` method that can be used
in combination with the ``with`` statement to activate a request context
temporarily.  With this you can access the :class:`~flask.request`,
:class:`~flask.g` and :class:`~flask.session` objects like in view
functions.  Here is a full example that demonstrates this approach::

    import flask

    app = flask.Flask(__name__)

    with app.test_request_context('/?name=Peter'):
        assert flask.request.path == '/'
        assert flask.request.args['name'] == 'Peter'

All the other objects that are context bound can be used in the same
way.

If you want to test your application with different configurations and
there does not seem to be a good way to do that, consider switching to
application factories (see :doc:`patterns/appfactories`).

Note however that if you are using a test request context, the
:meth:`~flask.Flask.before_request` and :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request`
functions are not called automatically.  However
:meth:`~flask.Flask.teardown_request` functions are indeed executed when
the test request context leaves the ``with`` block.  If you do want the
:meth:`~flask.Flask.before_request` functions to be called as well, you
need to call :meth:`~flask.Flask.preprocess_request` yourself::

    app = flask.Flask(__name__)

    with app.test_request_context('/?name=Peter'):
        app.preprocess_request()
        ...

This can be necessary to open database connections or something similar
depending on how your application was designed.

If you want to call the :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` functions you
need to call into :meth:`~flask.Flask.process_response` which however
requires that you pass it a response object::

    app = flask.Flask(__name__)

    with app.test_request_context('/?name=Peter'):
        resp = Response('...')
        resp = app.process_response(resp)
        ...

This in general is less useful because at that point you can directly
start using the test client.

.. _faking-resources:

Faking Resources and Context
----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.10

A very common pattern is to store user authorization information and
database connections on the application context or the :attr:`flask.g`
object.  The general pattern for this is to put the object on there on
first usage and then to remove it on a teardown.  Imagine for instance
this code to get the current user::

    def get_user():
        user = getattr(g, 'user', None)
        if user is None:
            user = fetch_current_user_from_database()
            g.user = user
        return user

For a test it would be nice to override this user from the outside without
having to change some code.  This can be accomplished with
hooking the :data:`flask.appcontext_pushed` signal::

    from contextlib import contextmanager
    from flask import appcontext_pushed, g

    @contextmanager
    def user_set(app, user):
        def handler(sender, **kwargs):
            g.user = user
        with appcontext_pushed.connected_to(handler, app):
            yield

And then to use it::

    from flask import json, jsonify

    @app.route('/users/me')
    def users_me():
        return jsonify(username=g.user.username)

    with user_set(app, my_user):
        with app.test_client() as c:
            resp = c.get('/users/me')
            data = json.loads(resp.data)
            self.assert_equal(data['username'], my_user.username)


Keeping the Context Around
--------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.4

Sometimes it is helpful to trigger a regular request but still keep the
context around for a little longer so that additional introspection can
happen.  With Flask 0.4 this is possible by using the
:meth:`~flask.Flask.test_client` with a ``with`` block::

    app = flask.Flask(__name__)

    with app.test_client() as c:
        rv = c.get('/?tequila=42')
        assert request.args['tequila'] == '42'

If you were to use just the :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_client` without
the ``with`` block, the ``assert`` would fail with an error because `request`
is no longer available (because you are trying to use it
outside of the actual request).


Accessing and Modifying Sessions
--------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.8

Sometimes it can be very helpful to access or modify the sessions from the
test client.  Generally there are two ways for this.  If you just want to
ensure that a session has certain keys set to certain values you can just
keep the context around and access :data:`flask.session`::

    with app.test_client() as c:
        rv = c.get('/')
        assert flask.session['foo'] == 42

This however does not make it possible to also modify the session or to
access the session before a request was fired.  Starting with Flask 0.8 we
provide a so called “session transaction” which simulates the appropriate
calls to open a session in the context of the test client and to modify
it. At the end of the transaction the session is stored and ready to be
used by the test client. This works independently of the session backend used::

    with app.test_client() as c:
        with c.session_transaction() as sess:
            sess['a_key'] = 'a value'

        # once this is reached the session was stored and ready to be used by the client
        c.get(...)

Note that in this case you have to use the ``sess`` object instead of the
:data:`flask.session` proxy.  The object however itself will provide the
same interface.


Testing JSON APIs
-----------------

.. versionadded:: 1.0

Flask has great support for JSON, and is a popular choice for building JSON
APIs. Making requests with JSON data and examining JSON data in responses is
very convenient::

    from flask import request, jsonify

    @app.route('/api/auth')
    def auth():
        json_data = request.get_json()
        email = json_data['email']
        password = json_data['password']
        return jsonify(token=generate_token(email, password))

    with app.test_client() as c:
        rv = c.post('/api/auth', json={
            'email': 'flask@example.com', 'password': 'secret'
        })
        json_data = rv.get_json()
        assert verify_token(email, json_data['token'])

Passing the ``json`` argument in the test client methods sets the request data
to the JSON-serialized object and sets the content type to
``application/json``. You can get the JSON data from the request or response
with ``get_json``.

Testing CLI Commands
--------------------

Click comes with `utilities for testing`_ your CLI commands. A
:class:`~click.testing.CliRunner` runs commands in isolation and
captures the output in a :class:`~click.testing.Result` object.

Flask provides :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a
:class:`~flask.testing.FlaskCliRunner` that passes the Flask app to the
CLI automatically. Use its :meth:`~flask.testing.FlaskCliRunner.invoke`
method to call commands in the same way they would be called from the
command line. ::

    import click

    @app.cli.command('hello')
    @click.option('--name', default='World')
    def hello_command(name):
        click.echo(f'Hello, {name}!')

    def test_hello():
        runner = app.test_cli_runner()

        # invoke the command directly
        result = runner.invoke(hello_command, ['--name', 'Flask'])
        assert 'Hello, Flask' in result.output

        # or by name
        result = runner.invoke(args=['hello'])
        assert 'World' in result.output

In the example above, invoking the command by name is useful because it
verifies that the command was correctly registered with the app.

If you want to test how your command parses parameters, without running
the command, use its :meth:`~click.BaseCommand.make_context` method.
This is useful for testing complex validation rules and custom types. ::

    def upper(ctx, param, value):
        if value is not None:
            return value.upper()

    @app.cli.command('hello')
    @click.option('--name', default='World', callback=upper)
    def hello_command(name):
        click.echo(f'Hello, {name}!')

    def test_hello_params():
        context = hello_command.make_context('hello', ['--name', 'flask'])
        assert context.params['name'] == 'FLASK'
