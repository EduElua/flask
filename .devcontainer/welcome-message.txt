👋  Welcome to Flask in Codespaces!

🛠️  Your environment is setup with all the required dependencies and your fork has been added as a remote.

🚀  To start coding, wait for the "postCreateCommand" to finish setting things up, then:
    - make sure the virtualenv is activated by running `. .venv/bin/activate`
    - run `git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/{main-or-latest-release}` to start working on a new feature or bug fix
