###Introduction

  // TODO - COMEÇAR LOGO AQUI A FALAR DE REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION??




<a name="purpose"/>
###Purpose
  The purpose of this document is to provide a quick overview of the funcionality of Flask in particular for developers and stackholders. The document will particulary detail the requirements elicitation and specification of the project, as well as the use cases and the domain model behind Flask.

<a name="scope"/>
###Scope









Flask is supported by an active, helpful community. Get involved by joining the mailing list and IRC channel. Discussion for developers using Flask as well as working on the core is welcome.

If someone want to spread the word, there is also a selection of badges and logos on Flask website. There are also shirts and mugs available at the Flask store, and stickers too.

Issues Tracker - for bugs and feature requests
Mailing List - for help and long term discussion
IRC Channel - for general help and discussion
Stack Overflow - for focused questions about code

###Description

// TODO - FALTA TERMINAR

  Flask is supported by a growing and active community, suppoted by a strong open-source spirit. Therefore, the process of evolution of Flask based on the requirements elicatation is relatively simple and informal, involving not only the Flask main contributors, but also all the surrounding community.
  The associated developers work to implement the established funcionality requirements, and also to fix the issues listed by contributors in the repository. Actually, Flask project provides a simple [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues) where is possible propose bug fixes as well feature requests. Some of the issues are tagged as begginner friendly so that newcomers can easily contribute to the project.

A Flask project is usually structered like the following tree folder:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/rodavoce/flask/blob/development/esof/res/flasktree.png">
</p>

This type of structure has the advantange of separating the static files like CSS or Javascript files, from the templates ones, usually written in HTML. The later ones are used in the routing implementation of Flask, allowing the reutilization of a template file for several script actions.
