#[Flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask) - web development, one drop at a time


### What is Flask?

Flask is a microframework for Python based on [Werkzeug](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug)
and [Jinja2](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2).  It's intended for getting started very quickly
and was developed with best intentions in mind.

### Is it ready?

It's still not 1.0 but it's shaping up nicely and is
already widely used.  Consider the API to slightly
improve over time but we don't plan on breaking it.

### What do I need?

All dependencies are installed by using `pip install Flask`.
We encourage you to use a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). Check the [docs](https://github.com/vivekanand1101/flask/tree/master/docs) for
complete installation and usage instructions.

### Where are the docs?

Go to the [online doc](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/) for a prebuilt version
of the current documentation.  Otherwise build them yourself
from the [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) sources [here](https://github.com/vivekanand1101/flask/tree/master/docs)

### Where are the tests?

Good that you're asking.  The tests are in [here](https://github.com/vivekanand1101/flask/tree/master/tests).  To run the tests use the
`py.test` testing tool:

    $ py.test

### Where can I get help?

Either use the `#pocoo` IRC channel on `irc.freenode.net` or
ask on the [mailinglist](http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/)

See [this](http://flask.pocoo.org/community/) for more resources.
